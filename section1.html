        The game aims to be realistic in a very punishing manner. 
        Your character has base statuses that you need to keep track of or else you'll die pretty quickly. 
        Each stat has multiple thresholds that determine how much health is being gained or lossed. 
        Thus, any stat that isn't health won't kill you by reaching 'zero' (really jsut the lowest threshold) 
        but it will drain your health at it's highest rate.
