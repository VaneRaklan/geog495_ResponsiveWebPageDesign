        I'm trying to refrain from letting my bad experiences in the game bleed into this content to I'm going to list off some stuff that happens in the game.

        <ul>
            <li>If you spend really any time in the rain:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your clothes will get moist or damp and you'll have to wring them out or you'll perpetually be cold</li>
                    <li>You can develop a cold which affects your stamina usage, causes you to sneeze 
                        which gives away your position to players, animals, and zombies</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can spread diseases to other players by being around them or by sharing food and drinks</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            <li>You can break bones which requires you to make a splint and have other stats be high enough to maintain your health or 
                you can die of shock (whether it's the shock itself, not being able to move anywhere to get resources, or passing out 
                in an inopportune situation like under water or in the open)</li>
            <li>If you don't wash your hands after handling raw meat and you eat something else like chips per se then you'll get sick</li>
            <li>Standing too close to a heat source or having too many freshly cooked foods stored in, say, your jacket and pants will cause you to overheat</li>
            <li>Drinking water or eating too fast while your sick will cause you to throw up</li>
        </ul>
